# Pattern-Project
This is a project found on "The Web Developer Bootcamp" on Udemy.com. It's purpose is to practice many components of bootstrap 4 learned within the section of the boot camp. I made a personal twist on the project by incorporating elements from my dog's instagram account. To view the images and icons, you must be connected to the internet and you must extract all contents of the zip file.
